## How It Works

### Creating a Vacation Group

1. Admin fills in group details (name, dates)
2. Firebase stores the group, assigns a Group ID
3. Admin shares Group ID with participants

### Participants Joining

1. Participants enter Group ID
2. Select their available dates (flexible or blocks)
3. Submit their name and availability
4. Firebase stores and syncs in real-time

### Finding Best Periods

1. Overlap algorithm checks every possible date range
2. Counts how many people are available for each range
3. Calculates availability percentage
4. Ranks by highest match (e.g., "100% available July 22-26!")

### Results

- Admin sees live results in dashboard
- Can filter by trip duration
- Export everything to CSV
- Send reminder emails
